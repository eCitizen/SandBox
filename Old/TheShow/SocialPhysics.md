Quotes from Sandy's Book:

Social Physics:

Page 4 - Social physics is a quantitative social science that describes reliable, mathematical connections between information and idea flow on the one hand and people's behavior on the other.  Social physics helps us understand how ideas flow from  person to person through the mechanism of social learning and how this flow of ideas ends up shaping the norms, productivity, and creative output of our companies, cities, and societies. 

Page 5 - Just as the goal of traditional physics is to understand how the flow of energy translates into changes in motion, social physics seeks to understand how the flow of ideas and information translates into changes in behavior.

Page 15 - two most important concepts in social physics:
     > idea flow within networks, and how it can be separated into exploration (finding new ideas/strategies) and engagement (getting everyone to coordinate their behavior).
     > social learning, which is how new ideas become habits, and how learning can be accelerated and shaped by social pressure.
