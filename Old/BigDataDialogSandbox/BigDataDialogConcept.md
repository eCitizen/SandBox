> I put together a dumb ass Wordpress site that supports some key
> aspects needed for national "dialogue" (sp "dialog" using modern form
> and as a nod to the blog) including: URL for each question; form to
> submit answers; sharing of submissions under open license so everyone
> can see and consider; periodic HangOuts to enable tighter discussion;
> GitHub repo to enable and promote engagement in synthesized themes and
> points of views on the issues and options relevant to each question
> and to the overarching real topic: what should be the legal and policy
> framework for big data?
>
> **More detail organized by system component:**
>
> * URL for each question:
> - A curated landing page on the blog for each question (starting with
> RFI questions from the White House and with room for refined or
> replacement questions to "bubble up") and
> - A corresponding GitHub file for each question (cross linked to/from
> the landing page) where perhaps scalable input to discussion on the
> question and another method of reflecting proposed refinements to and
> commentary upon the questions can occur via branches, forks, pull
> requests, etc
>
> * web form to gather responses to the White House questions
> (minimally) and the then current or past version of crowd sourced
> questions (by just including the URL to the commit).
>
> * Placeholder for the data comprising the responses to the questions:
> - The google spreadsheet can be displayed directly in various ways
> that allow sort, filter and search;
> - The response data can be further refined by curated and crowd
> sourced annotations and looking at options from simple (ie: standard
> structuring of annotations method to just include the URL of the
> individual response and hook it all up on the back end) to more
> complex (eg: am liking the OKF open annotation project).
> - The data science gurus of Sandy's group or perhaps others could do
> their analytics and I hope reveal deeper insights into the data ...
> what if there were a quickly set up research study allowing informed
> consent to include a Facebook and Twitter app version of the survey
> that by OAuth2 grant of permission enabled access to some deeper
> dimensions of social and behavioral data about respondents to the
> questions or to a consumer facing version of big data policy
> questions... in that case Sandy and his contemporaries or their teams
> could possibly see much deeper insights which could help with
> development of better aligned policy).
>
> * Each response has an open license chosen by the participant who
> contributed the content (via pill down menu) and the trick from the
> point is simply to continuously bind the license to the content
> thorough the workflow and very conspicuously obligate those who may
> take the data downstream to do further analytics or integrate with
> more dialog and debate and decision making apps or services.
>
> * Periodic Google HangOuts
> - I would like to do a hangout on all questions one at a time with
> panelists holding varied points of view and to use the hangout to
> surface some of the more interesting (and/or perhaps by then highly
> rated) responses from the big internet;
> - I would like to do a hangout on each question individually and have
> panelists that are deep in each of those topics (ie question 5 on
> cross jurisdictional issues would include experts and advocates that
> are different from question 3 on the benefits of big data) and
> hopefully spur deeper responses on the issues one question at a time;
> - I would like to hold a few "let's talk about a deal" type HangOuts
> with top thinkers, decision makers and perhaps by then proponents of
> proposals that are very highly rated to discuss the possible
> composition of one or more comprehensive legal and policy framework
> for big data that reflect the good ideas contributed and considered to
> date. Minimally this would also provide a fitting forum for Sandy or
> his proxy to describe the "New Deal on Data" approach and in that way
> ensure it gets a fair shake. Personally I'd be surprised (very
> pleasantly) if any better comprehensive framework emerged from the
> open dialog. If there is something better I would like to know it and
> so should the White House and the country at large. If there is not,
> then at least I am certain there will be one plausible and attractive
> proposal to start with and that could survive and emerge from a
> national dialog.

> **Regulation Room?**
