\f0\fs24 \cf0 - Time zone confusion with Mark's hackathon. Can google hangout rest API bulk change time zones?\
- We need to put the Blog on the menu! so it is easily accessible.\
- We need to create and post a form where speakers can suggest topics and participants will vote.\
- Develop API that pulls the contents of a web form to populate a Sched.org session. [ it will not be necessary for this API to use the form data to populate a google hangout because we have already provisioned those. However, we would like to collect data on who is attending each session and develop an API that can pull that data and use it to send Google hangout invitations.]}
