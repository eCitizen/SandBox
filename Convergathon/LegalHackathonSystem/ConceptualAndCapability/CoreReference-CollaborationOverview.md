COLLABORATE

The support of better small-team collaboration to create innovative ideas, designs, prototypes and other artifacts is a key priority for the MIT Legal Hackathon.

By using aspects of the “open space” unconference method, participants will have the option to offer new discussion sessions, invite participation on projects and to form teams. Alternatively, any participant may choose to more passively select sessions to monitor or lightly contribute comments or questions within.

At 2pm it is expected participants will be ready to select the sessions and/or projects they wish to participate in. By clicking on the event on the schedule (at LegalHackathon.info) participants will see a description of the session or project and can click a link directly to the respective LegalHackathon.org custom page for live collaboration by participants in that session.

As of June 2, the plan is to provide these custom pages under the name of “Collaboration Rooms”. Each Collaboration Room page has a common template with links to a set of selected pre-configured collaboration services that can be customized as needed. The template links to services such as group note taking at a LegalHackathon.Hackpad.com notes page for each session (using a common name style indicating the Session title and Date-Time), an embedded Google Hangout or WebEx (unless Media Lab Unhangout is being used at that point), a link to a corresponding GitHub repository (by default, at: http://github.com/orgs/LegalHackathon or to a different repository as appropriate for the project), links to relevant backround materials and other collaboration services or tools that may be needed (eg the data analytics sessions are integrating task-specific embedded apps), and a standard link to the session description in the LegalHackathon.info program.

The act of proposing a session via the LegalHackathon.org forms-based workflow results with all the needed information needed to provision an appropriately configured Collaboration Room for that session and further refinement is as easy as updating a wordpress blog post. The staff and volunteers stand by to assist with that if needed but each session designates at least one participant to take the role of blog page updater. That participant is provided read/write authorization for the Collaboration Room page used by their group.

Eventually, with more refinement, no special admin access will be necessary and the entire page will be completely automatically configured for each group.  Advancing the state of the art for scalable collaboration may catalyze new types of teamwork and innovative design, prototype, test and build practices.

More detail and documentation as well as pre-hackathon demos and hangouts about the online collaboration process is being added to this blog regularly.
