ONLINE HACKATHON TEAM COLLABORATION POTENTIAL

JUNE 3, 2014 DAZZA GREENWOOD

The common and extensible approach used for this MIT Legal Hackathon is intended to enable cross-team collaborations (of which several are expected, including between the annotation and open data statutes/regulations projects).  By using a common approach, the method of supporting deeper teamwork can be extended to support regularized, simple and frequent cross-team collaborations.

Eventually, the social practices, decision making procedures and technical processes adopted, adapted and evolved to support and reflect ever better cross-team collaboration can be leveraged to achieve to make possible even more innovation and powerful results in even less time.  This potential is worth exploring and considering.

Deliberately and explicitly aligned business, legal and technical layers of collaboration enable harmonization and integration resulting in full “interoperability” among distributed, heterogeneous and voluntary clusters of participants.  A new source of repeatable high value creation may be available by enabling such teams to easily collaborate.

Such a design is intended to enable a realistic method and mechanism for tackling much more complex and larger scale challenges by composing virtual innovation factories and idea machines from teams of teams in systems of systems. This blog post describes some of the conceptual architecture of such a method and mechanism (in this case, by leveraging the existing context and workflows of an MIT MOOC on the edX platform).

In the MOOC context, above, it is assumed that teams will form “on the fly” or that they could perhaps in some cases be chosen on the basis of big data analytics.  While there is certainly value in optimizing the challenge of new team formation on a project by project basis, there may also be value in supporting longer team lifespans.

Some teams will display high performance in one or more definable and repeatable capabilities or other skills or may be able to develop such performance by practice or skill building.  Some teams may seek to remain together and enter several hackathons or other large scale innovations competitions or markets.  When a wide variety of  high performance small teams can use simple and effective means to discover and collaborate with complementary teams then potentially very creative and self-organizing solution-companies could tailor themselves together around particular challenges.

The capacity to quickly combine then dissolve when the job is done and then come together in a fresh combination suited for the next job is not prevalent (or noticeable) in most industries and workplaces.  Yet, the ability of a team to dynamically recombine to meet a given challenge and to adapt to the relevant environment to achieve a given goal may be of profound importance.  Many existing systems should be able to  operate better/cheaper/faster with access to such teams .

Whether individuals, teams, clusters of teams or any combination is pursued, the basic approach of an online unconference will provide ample opportunity for innovation and advancement on the law in context.  The living record of each project presentation and cycle of team work will include the basic information needed to observe what advances are happening and how they are occurring.
