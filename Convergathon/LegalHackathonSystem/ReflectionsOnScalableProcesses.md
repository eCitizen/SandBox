# Scalable Deliberative Assembly Services

By tieing each contribution to one or more of the numbered Core Questions of the Hackathon and publishing them in real-time for all participants to review and consider, this process flow illustrates one of the LegalHackathon.org "scalable plenary assembly service" capabilities needed for very large numbers of people to engage serious or official discussion, deliberation, debate and in some cases decision.  

# High Velocity Large Volume Tailored Collaboration Support and Customization

high volume and velocity project based team formation (using forms-driven project proposals and a plenary session for proposers to describe their project in a hot minute then providing a short period for participants to select project or to request recommendations or to be assigned to a project.  If people wish to be assigned, then the LegalHackathon.org service can apply a simple scoring formular to determine a person-project priority pairing.   Each team is at liberty the tools and practices by which the members agree to operate.  However, any team using the LegalHackathon scalable collaboration system is automatically provisions a lightly customized virtual studio space with a set of basic collaboration services pre-configured for individual teams based on which converged topic the project is tackling and also for individual people based on their applicable role on the project team.  The LegalHackathon.org system can also support automated submission of final presentations and publishing of submitted projects into an indexed gallery (housed at projects.legalhackathon.org)

# Hacking Description

HACKING
The aim of this Hackathon is to share is discuss your ideas and those of other participants in a forum enabling you to collaborate and come up with solutions to big issues raised by the Hackathon’s Four Core Questions.
Here is how to get Hacking:

First and foremost, this event is about identifying key timely issues, options and prospects for progress on personal data control. We have identified the Hackathon’s Four Core Questions and invite every participant to share your views, ideas and other contributions on each of these four important topics. Please take a moment to add at least one contribution now to one or more of the four questions using the form.

Don’t worry – no forms needed for any of the other wonderful tools and services we made available to support your communication, contribution and collaboration in this event!

Use our Open Knowledge Foundation Etherpads for an easy and effective way to informally communicate with other participants and panelists. All participants are invited to share perspectives, ideas and other notes on our etherpads. The Etherpads are great because they enable simple and open canvas for all participants to read and write notes together – in immediate real-time or periodically over hours, days etc (asynchronously). Therefore, participants are also strongly encouraged to add ideas, questions, links or other relevant topics to the notes shared by other participants. We have created dedicated session-by-session oriented Etherpads (embedded right in the event pages for each session) and also an Event-Wide Etherpad (embedded at the bottom of this page and for ease of access at our “Event-Wide Etherpad” page). Other communications channels such as our Convergathon IRC chat, the event hashtags on Twitter or any method people wish to use.

There is also an IRC chat happening, and many sessions engage though Twitter. The main Virtual Venue method for live “face-to-face” conversation is our Session Hangout Broadcasts. Each panel and other scheduled session has a Google Hangout embedded directly in it’s own page. Each Hangout is created and can be found at our LegalHackathon Google+ LegalHackathon Page (where you will also find a corresponding Google+ Event, which some participants may find a great avenue for their existing robust Google+ social networking, comments and sharing).

Step-by-Step

 Check out the Hackathon’s Four Core Questions and Contribute Your Ideas (eg: solutions, proposals or even more questions for future work)
Join the Berlin Workshop on Hacking Competition and Collaboration and Learn About Engaging Like This:
If you have a project idea, technology or some good ideas, you can also include it on the etherpad below – with a brief description.
If you see a big issue you want to tackle put your name (or nickname) down below the issue.
The resulting people under that issue can choose to collaborate and work as one or more teams
As a team, look at the technology, people, and ideas.
Self Organise – Collaborate to put these together to make a solution, and maybe even add to the Convergathon Roadmap.
Present this for judging on Sunday
If the number of participants requires a clearer and more scalable process, the MIT LegalHackathon.org unconference process might be used to allow people to propose projects using a form and to use the virtual plenary and rating system to join projects and the online collaboration templates to work together in teams.
 Check out the core questions and contribute answers and issues
First, contribute your solutions and ideas.

Solutions, ideas, projects, proposals and other idea are contributed to the larger event discussion by speakers, panelists, moderators and all participants. In fact, the panel and other discussion sessions are designed and MC’d to stimulate everybody’s thinking and engagement on the underlying issues, options, problems and prospects arising from the Hackathon’s Four Core Questions.

Then, people will be invited to pick a big issue, put their name down under it, the resulting team can then collaborate to propose  solutions using a combination of tech, ideas, and inspiration.

Sunday will be discussion/hack Sessions: If you are remote and you want to get involved = we will work to organise different hangouts (timezone permitting) for people.
