Dazza,
Hope you had a Merry Christmas. I am following up on our discussion about The Show. I would love to talk again tomorrow or Friday morning, if you are free.
Below are some ideas that I have been exploring.  

First, I am interested in discussing how to narrow down the content to determine what we will do for each show. It sounds like there are a lot of potential topics and it is difficult for me to see how the various ideas fit together.  I would like to spend some time with you and the other people working on the project determining what the various topics will be. I am happy to take a first pass tomorrow on writing and organizing some ideas.

Second, I have an idea for a segment that I think you will appreciate.  A lot of people have heard the term "big data", but very few people know what it means. Even among the experts, there is some disagreement over the term. I propose we do a segment called "What is Big Data?" that intersperses experts like Sandy explaining what big data is with "man on the street"/"Jaywalking" type of humorous videos where we ask random people what they think big data is.

Finally, I have some thoughts on using analytics to improve the content of the show.  I have always been intrigued by the idea of customized learning in online education. One way to do this is for the teacher to record multiple videos explaining the same concept in different ways to accommodate different learning styles. Then the class software uses an algorithm to match the correct explanation type to each individual students.We could do a similar thing with the Show where we solicit videos from different contributors with different backgrounds explaining the same topic and then work to match those videos with the people we think would most appreciate them.  
For example in my Big Data proposal, we can ask different contributors to explain Big Data to different audiences. We can differentiate by learning styles such as visual, kinesthetic, and auditory learners or professions such as C-suite executives, mathematicians, and politicians. Then we can incorporate recommender engines that utilize viewer ratings and metadata to guide people to the best explanation for their learning style and experience.

I would love to discuss these ideas and others as soon as you are available. Please let me know what times may work for you.
David
