Hi Sandy, Joi,

Just wanted to let you know the idea for a "show" (in the model of the audience-driven webcast I designed for Amanda Palmer's event at the Media Lab) seems to be getting some good feedback.  Idea is to leverage personalized content, create federated hosting/production, deeply engage audience and to make it fun and thoughtful.  Below is the biggest "bite", Alberto of Knight Foundation suggesting Arianna Huffington collaborate (and her apparently agreeing).  

I've got a treatment and general plan to produce a pilot start of fall semester - will hone that and send for your review.  Would appreciate feedback and guidance from you Sandy and Joi.  

Thanks,
 - Dazza

Arianna,

Something else for your team to consider:

I just finished hosting our annual seminar at Aspen Institute on media and society.   As usual, it was a spectacular 2 ½ days of ideas and possible projects.

One of the participants this year as Dazza Greenwood of MIT’s Media Lab.  I assume you’re familiar w/the MediaLab, which has and continues to amaze for its volume and quality of media inventions.

At Aspen, Dazza told me about an idea for a web-based, interactive tv show that would feature, live from the MediaLab, the whiz-bang stuff they and other programmer/engineer colleagues are working on.  Their tentative title tells the story: “30 Minutes From the Future.”

His original thought was to try to do this on their own from the MediaLab.  I told him a little about HuffPo Live and that he should try to talk w/folks there, since they’re looking for quality content and he has it.

No obligation but, if you’re interested, here’s his contact information:

Dazza Greenwood

telephone:  (650) 504-5474

I hope you’re well and having a good summer.

A new media variety show featuring

* Network the Lab - Literally. 


2. Key Segments:


1. MC'd (Dazza)
2. Magic Demo's (Media Lab students/professors)
3. Interview(s) (Big Thinkers, Key Topics - possibly prep John, Sandy for interviewer role)
4. Performance (Culture, Art, Music, Etc - talk through a painting or game even?)
5. Break-Out Engagement (Clinics, Games, Charrettes and BigDialogs) [NightLine "level-setting" segments and "exercises" for participation on the topic/challenge) (OmniVidual?) 
6. Newx/Reviews (DailyDot, SlashDot, BoingBoing) 
7. Outlook (Previews, Predictions and Portents - including SET UP FOR FUTURE EPISODES)

5. Tactical / Objectives / Value 


* IDcubed Team Activation
