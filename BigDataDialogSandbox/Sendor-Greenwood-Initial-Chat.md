... in sum: I think some White House announcements echoed by MIT, NYU blasts to those who expressed interest in the first two in person workshops and - importantly - also by UC Berkeley to those who are expressing interest in the next/last/3rd workshop happening April 1 in the East Bay... and from there just a normal media campaign via friends, family and friendly tribes (American Bar Association and state bar groups, Tech trade associations, PolySci groups, blogs/twitter, etc to pump up engagement.... students might be key).  That is the secret plan.  Plus... really fun hangouts that periodically punctuate the feedback to provide a) exploration of the trends and insight to the contributions to date, b) inviting popular or especially interesting contributions to join in a hangout or prior call or email etc to describe the ideas more and relate the idea or question to other contributions or topics and using hangouts to do deeper engagement and give natural break-points for "rounds" of feedback enabling potentially self-organizing synthsis, teams gathering behind ideas, maybe some sort of incentives to form coalitions or other tools for people to discover and adapt to one another in dynamic idea flow...

whew - that was a mouth full (or finger full?)
----

  
**David:**  seriously. that sounds like a lot of secret ideas, rather than just one
but having White House backing would be great
Are you posting the contributions anywhere?
 
**Dazza:**  Notice, however, that precisely one of us is a data scientist.  And please note that no other data scientist at the lab has expressed any interest to provide guidance on how to crunch the contributions for this project.  It is seen as a lawyer thing... hence - there is a high impact (potentially) playground for Mr. David (Data) Sendor.
----
  
**David:**  interesting. That's somewhat dissapointing as they really need input from computer scientists
 
**Dazza:**  Yes, once I actually get contributions, I plan to post them at a) the blog BigDataDialog.org and b) the corresponding GitHub file repo to which the questions are linked - encouraging many ways to permit scalable self-organizations.
  
**David:**  but I also think, as we have discussed before, that most people don't really understand big data
I really like the idea of living documents, that people can take parts of and add to
 
**Dazza:**  I noticed there are several easy and robust ways to let people play dynamically with Google Spreadsheets embedded into web pages OR to put the data behind some APIs enabling folks to get more fancy.... and i suppose folks could always download the corpus (the CC licenses must stay with the data)
  
**David:**  it depends on what shows up
 
**Dazza:**  yes, i see what you mean.
  
**David:**  the other idea would be a reddit type of conversation where people can vote up ideas
or like we discussed an amalgamation where people can branch off good ideas and add to them, reddit+github
it can get confusing, but I think that if it is done correctly it could be a great tool for massive collaboration

**David:**  person A uploads an idea to a repository, people can then either vote on that idea or branch off from it. We then create a scoring system to allow us to find the best ideas and additions to those ideas
 
**Dazza:**  Well - it was greet timing that Sandy invoked you today of all days.  I would be very very interested in the best ways to enable a rating systems.  And other forms of annotation.  I believe the core-key-foundation must be to associate each contribution with a unique URL.  From there, ratings, linking further thoughts, etc is relatively simple.  Then the threads of lineage, provenance and interlapping branches etc can be easily tracked over time.  Right?
I am emailing you a short riff on how I imagine supporting what you are describing now...

**David:**  for example, let's say that person A proposes an idea. Person B then up votes it, Person C comes along and makes an update to Person A's idea, then we suggest to Person B that they should check out Person C's update. On a large scale this could really help collaboartion
yes, each piece needs a unique ID. not necessarily a URl though
but I think that URLs are definitely a good start
 
**Dazza:**  exactly.  having each idea and rev of the idea at a URL makes it possible - and relatively simple - to play out the person A to B to C to A scenario while supporting multiple versions and forks or branches... hence: GitHub.
  
**David:**  definitely. 
we'd need to add a voting system and some sort of scoring and ranking method
 Sent at 9:21 PM on Tuesday
 
**Dazza:**  (Each  Version - w/r/t commits - have a unique URL that includes some hash string data to make the provenance delightful (if I understand it correctly).  That ensures a clear signal on what is being voted upon.  The method of rating/voting the thing at the URL I am not too sure about... nor am I clear on what sorts of data modeling and analysis is possible or preferred as a starting position... but I know a guy...
in Lexington...
  
**David:**  haha
Yeah, the key thing, as always is doing somthing simple that can be added to
I'm just not sure what platforms there are out there to do this
it is fairly simple, we just have to find the platform
 Sent at 9:24 PM on Tuesday
 
**Dazza:**  Yes - finding a platform (or better yet, a basic way to gather, and make accessible, the raw data so many platforms, apps or tools can do the rating in varied ways) is key.  ALSO - more generally - describing analytics that can be done IF/WHEN there are enough contributions and then USE THAT insight to a) describe a wonderful idea the White House and others would want to support and push and b) I predict knowing some things about likely analytics to be desired / planned would inform how best to structure the form and data gathering process (so as to gather the right data in the right way to enable the smart ideas of the data scientist).
 Sent at 9:27 PM on Tuesday
  
**David:**  Analytics-wise I think the key thing is a simple scoring and recommending system that allows people to find and edit ideas that interest them
 
**Dazza:**  Yes, that is functionally the top priority... however...
  
**David:**  I'm not sure what can be done with analyzing the data themselves
We need humans to curate the ideas, but we are trying to guide them
 Sent at 9:31 PM on Tuesday
 
**Dazza:**  There is a meta-play here, methinks... If there were a few nifty "can also do THIS" type analytics, trends, relationships BETWEEN ideas or AMONG ideas, and MOST IMPORTANT: Visualizations of Social or Idea Maps between - say - ideas that cite each other or tend to merge or people who cite each others ideas or comment or rate them (high or low) and how those groups of people look or change... you see?
  
**David:**  Do you have any notes from any of the Hangouts or NYU session? I am sure that some good ideas have already been proposed
 
**Dazza:**  Then we have some Social Physics and Human Dynamics on the data ABOUT the data (about the policy needed for big data).  It's pretty meta.
  
**David:**  definitely, I think that we could use analytics to show the value in this methodlogy as well as guiding people, and perhaps even suggestions on what ideas to merge together
 
**Dazza:**  yes, i believe the entire sessions in video form are available.
  
**David:**  are there transcripts though?
doesn't Youtube have some sort of transcribing feature?
 Sent at 9:34 PM on Tuesday
 
**Dazza:**  um... i don't think there are transcripts.  not sure.  youtube does do that.  and if there is an important reason, we could also maybe attract a little budget to get somebody (or many bodies) to take chunks of hours and type out what was said on the video, including tagging content to speakers.
  
**David:**  I just think it's an easy way to catalyze the conversation
 
**Dazza:**  hmmm.... ok.  good idea!
  
**David:**  I think that if we put ideas out there, it will be easier to get others to open up
 Sent at 9:36 PM on Tuesday
 
**Dazza:**  well... i have a pretty good sense of how to establish just what the identifiable "significant" ideas were at the last couple workshops.  I would ask the organizers and if needed go back through the videos myself to note the "big ideas" (w/minute-second markers and attribution and some relation to one or more RFI questions)... I am sure I can get some grad students and others to assist in that game.  Then...
The ideas could get a page per idea on the blog and/or a GitHub file... so they can be used as fodder and chum...
  
**David:**  Yes, I think that writing down the big ideas and then sending them to the speakers for their input will get them to add to them and refine them
 
**Dazza:**  That, Mr. Sendor, is a great idea about great ideas.
  
**David:**  meta
 
**Dazza:**  Also- turns out there are quite a few online dialog, discussion, deliberation, debate, etc services / apps "out there"... some of them have already expressed willingness to play along.
  
**David:**  yes, that is definitely a good approach
i'm sure a lot of people have already created content
 
**Dazza:**  In particular:  https://www.loomio.org and RegulationRoom.org
  
**David:**  the idea is to gather the people and their content (where possible)
 Sent at 9:42 PM on Tuesday
  
**David:**  I saw something about loomio recently
 
**Dazza:**  i have a good relationship with the loomio folks.  good people.  and a great tool.
