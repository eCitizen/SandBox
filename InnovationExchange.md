David Sendor-Israel's Innovation Exchange Concept

* The best way to value an asset is by it's value in an efficient market.  
* Patents have no efficient market (and can scarecely be said to have a "market" at all!)
* An efficient market for patents would be of value to many stakeholders and society at large
