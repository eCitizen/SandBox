# MIT Human Dynamics Lab: Notes on David Sendor-Israel's Innovation Exchange Concept


Axiomatic Points:

<li> The best way to value an asset is by it's value in an efficient market.  
<li> Patents have no efficient market (and can scarecely be said to have a "market" at all!)  
<li> An efficient market for patents would be of value to many stakeholders and society at large

* The Innovation Exchange PPT Presentation   

## Brainstorm:

* Direct Synergy with Sandy Pentland, vis:  
    1) the academic aspect of valuation of ideas/IP and   
    2) the notion of an exchange market for innovation (a "trust network" of sorts)  
* Synergies with Tim Rowe of Cambridge Innovation Center (CIC) 
* Synergies with Joi Ito and his interest to promote innovation via creative IP arrangements
