# MIT Human Dynamics Lab: Notes on David Sendor-Israel's Innovation Exchange Concept

Update March 18, 2014: Sandy mentioned a desired to work on innovation systems today at the group research meeting.  I sent the innovation exchange idea and mentioned it.  He suggested looking at honey bee network in india.  See:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Innovation_Foundation_-_India

Axiomatic Points:

<li> The best way to value an asset is by it's value in an efficient market.  
<li> Patents have no efficient market (and can scarecely be said to have a "market" at all!)  
<li> An efficient market for patents would be of value to many stakeholders and society at large

* The Innovation Exchange PPT Presentation   

## Brainstorm:

* Direct Synergy with Sandy Pentland, vis:  
    1) the academic aspect of valuation of ideas/IP and   
    2) the notion of an exchange market for innovation (a "trust network" of sorts)  
* Synergies with Tim Rowe of Cambridge Innovation Center (CIC) 
* Synergies with Joi Ito and his interest to promote innovation via creative IP arrangements

# This Idea could be a great segment for "The Show" (IAP project this January).  Here is some info on that:
* Background: [https://github.com/dazzaji/TheShow](https://github.com/dazzaji/TheShow) for the primary files  
* Project initial anchor blog post at: [https://ecitizen.mit.edu/TheShow](https://ecitizen.mit.edu/TheShow)   Sandy gave thumbs up to the text at ecitizen.mit.edu and I'm fixing to submit it later today to the IAP registration system...
