Hey Mark,

We have some suggestions to improve the user flow for signing up (registration). We would like to suggest also embedding the eventbrite registration into an event site page and from here forward pointing people to the same single URL for everything related to the event (eg to register, go to OpenNotice.leg.../blah) and (to registr, just click the 'register' on the top menu of the event site"). 

Instead of sending users to datacontrolhack2014.sched.org we should send them to http://opennotice.legalhackathon.org/signup. On that page, users will find an embed of the Eventbrite ticket registration. Let me know how this sounds to you.


Best,
Nader
