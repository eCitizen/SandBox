Hey Mark,

We have some suggestions to improve the user flow for signing up (registration). We would like to suggest also embedding the eventbrite registration into an event site page and from here forward pointing people to the same single URL for everything related to the event (eg to register, go to OpenNotice.leg.../blah) and (to registr, just click the 'register' on the top menu of the event site"). 

Instead of sending users to datacontrolhack2014.sched.org we should send them to http://opennotice.legalhackathon.org/signup. On that page, users will find an embed of the Eventbrite ticket registration. Let me know how this sounds to you.

Best,
Nader

- Need to add OKF logo to sponsors page.. please remove chat from home page (and all other pages as it sucks)
- Need hacking page as a main page
- I have made an event template page (so when making page you can select event template) this was for live page - am not sure why you donâ€™t get this? its simple way for live event engagement 
-  not sure what harm you think a live page will do to the site, it has nothing to do with creating content or interfering with the flow.. It just uses the posts pages and features the live session with a chat.  It make site usable.live .  
- I have someone who can man this page during the event, but I NEED to soon to tell them yes or no
- on schedule page please remove the link that takes people out of the site - this will piss people off and screws up the flow - put a link to sched.org and I suggest a screen shot of the printable schedule (e.g. via printable version on this page0 

All that is left is to discuss
1. changes to navigation : lets do this together at some point.  I need sponsor page used properly so lets talk about this when we do navigation. 
2. what will be on home page (so people can engage in live event) or should we just forget about making the website usable for the live event at this stage considering where we are now? 
3. adding featured to session posts when they are finished or live (note - this is not so good as it just creates a grid)  unless there is some posts with instructions. 

- we could take current home page and make it a featured post with a screen shot of sponsors logos and put at the first, but I think the template will move it to last Unless we can number them ( i will check later)
