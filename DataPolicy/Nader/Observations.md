Nader's Recommendations:

1a. Standard Open Data Formats: The policy requires both a standardized format for the publishing of the data as well as an open data portal on which the data will be published. The CIO’s policy should address whether or not the portal will already have its own standardized data format. If it does not, who will determine the format of the published data? Because many public departments store their data on multiple platforms, this section of the policy will need to address how data selected for open sharing – which exists in various formats and on various platforms – will be standardized. This is a question about standardizing formats of the data that departments choose to share. 

2a. Method for Classifying Public Data: If the departments will be the ones responsible for sharing their data, why is it necessary to develop a method for sharing data classifications with the CIO? Departments choose whether or not their data will be public so why does the CIO need to access these classifications before the data goes public? 

3a. Who Publishes the Data: The policy will need to address how the departments will access the open data portal. It will also need to address the extent to which the CIO’s office organizes the organization of the portal and the metadata used on the portal. 

4a. Guidance on minimum documentation for public data: Who will decide what the minimum documentation for public data will be? Will the CIO’s office do so as they organize the data on the open data portal? Or, will the respective department already have organized public data into a documentation format before sharing it on the open portal? Will a public user be able to modify the documentation? For example, Will the public have the capacity to organize the metadata? The question of WHO determines the data’s documentation is crucial to the policy’s ability to provide a clear outline of the structure of the open data portal.
